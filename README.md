Legal_Brief_Using_LaTeX
=======================

This is a LaTeX template file (`LegalBrief.tex`) for  generating legal briefs, with the line numbering and formatting commonly used by lawyers in the United States.

This template uses LaTeX's Wallpaper package, incorporating the line numbers and borders from a separate PDF file (which was also generated using LaTeX). Make sure to place the file `BriefBkgd.pdf` in the same folder as your working template.

To satisfy court-specific formatting requirements, you can edit the dimensions in the brief paper template file `BriefBkgd.tex` and generate a brand new `BriefBkgd.pdf` file. However, after making such changes, you may have to alter the borders and line spacing in `LegalBrief.tex` accordingly.

The PDF `Legal_Brief_Using_LaTeX.pdf` demonstrates the output and includes additional directions on use. The template file `LegalBrief.tex` also contains detailed comments.
