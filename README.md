Legal_Brief_Using_LaTeX
=======================

This is a LaTex template file for  generating legal briefs, with the line numbering and formatting commonly used by attorneys in the United States.

This template uses LaTeX's Wallpaper package, incorporating the line numbers and borders from a separate pdf file (which was also generated using LaTeX). Make sure to place the file BriefBkgd.pdf in the same folder as your working template.

The PDF `Legal_Brief_Using_LaTeX.pdf` demonstrates the output and includes additional directions on use. The template file also contains extensive comments.
